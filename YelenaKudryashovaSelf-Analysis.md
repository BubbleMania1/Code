Introduction to Programming 1/2A

Self Analysis

    During the project, I worked on the flowchart and the project description with Pulkita and Andrew. We worked with Alex to understand what he was programming and then put it into a flowchart. I also made sure that we were submitting the items on time and that we were working efficiently. I was the graphics designed so I helped come up with the visual aspects of the game to make it look more appealing. In addition, I created the levels and their patterns in detail, making it easier for the coders to code the levels. I included points for all of the bubbles and equations with which they could create these levels. I also helped input them into processing.  Using if statements to write the equations for x and y coordinates of the ball based on the specific number of that array, we created levels that were more complex as we built more and more levels. I also helped create ideas for the type of power ups there would be and for the initial idea of the BubbleMania- type game.    
    
    I think that a couple of things went very well in the group. We had members that were strong with processing and others that were good at making flowcharts. This way, our work was consistent throughout the project. Additionally, we chose an idea that was basic but could be revised to be more complex. That way, we started off with something that was comfortable to code and made it more complex as we went along. 
    
    I think that the team could have communicated a little better so that everyone knew about the changes that were going on with the coding. However, overall, I am happy with how our team worked together.
