Introduction to Programming

Bubble Kraze

I honestly think that this was a great final. Throughout the days of working on it, I not only learned the importance of being a project manager and making sure our team was headed on the right path, but I also learned how to work well in a team. This was a very different team project than we usually do not do in school; it was more like an engineering team and I loved it. Because I want to become an engineer when I am older, I think that this really gave me an idea of how I will have to work. This final also taught me a lot about coding and creating games on Processing. Before, I was never really confident in my abilities to create coding, but after thoroughly working on the project description and the flow chart, the coding process started to make a lot more sense. 
  
My job as a project manager required me to interact with group members and make sure every one was doing their jobs well and on time. Yelena and I worked together to write the initial and final Project Description. I also thoroughly worked on the flowchart for days because as new code was added, I had to update the flowchart. The flowchart was actually harder than it looked! There was so much detail and thought put into the style and formation of the flowchart and what/how to explain it. Yelena and Andrew also helped with the flowchart and helped to check it over and make sure it was complete. Our flowchart, by the end, became very lengthy for we had put in as much detail as possible. My job was to add in all the information and explain the different commands and such and then Yelena went back and changed the bubble shape according to what was written in it. Andrew helped me out with adding in all the information as well. 
	
To move the project along, I always helped any team member that was stuck. While working on the project description and flow chart, there were times when Yelena, Andrew, or I didn’t know what to write and so became stuck in the process. When it was Yelena and Andrew, I would always help them out and figure how to help them complete their task, especially on designing the different levels. Sometimes Yelena could not think of another design for a level so I would help her and I actually designed over 5 of the levels in the game.
I also did coding. Andrew and I, together, coded the different levels with the arrangements of the balls. We had to write codes that would create the pattern of the balls on each level. For example: case 1: if (j<14) { temp.x …..} break; 
The dot dot dot represents the coding that defined the arrangement of the first 14 balls on the level (ball 0 counts as well) and j is our variable for the number of balls. When creating the coding, it was difficult sometimes to make the level look exactly like our designs but after time, we were able to make it look perfect! We kept changing the code until we thought the level looked just as we wanted it.  Sometimes we would not only have to change the location of the balls but also the slope of the pattern of balls which took a bit to get used to (how the numbers affect the slope in particular). Every time we made a new level, we updated the void setup because that’s where we determined how many levels there were. In total, Andrew and I created ten levels. After doing so, I actually felt really proud of myself because I understood what I was doing!
	
I would just like to acknowledge that Alex is simply a coding genius and he explained to me and Andrew how we had to do the coding which made it a lot easier for us to do. 
	
I think overall, everything went really well. Our project description and flowchart were done in a timely manner and were kept updated throughout the whole process. Our coding also improved and enhanced every class period so I definitely think we used the time given very effectively. For improvements, I definitely wish I had done or at least tried to do more coding because I should give myself more credit for my capabilities. Even though Alex did an amazing job with the coding, I wish I had partook a little more in that process because even though it wasn’t my job to, I still think that coding is fun and I want to learn it better. As a whole, I think that the team could have been a little bit more productive because certain members would get off track at times. Other than that, I think our team worked very well together. All in all, it was a great experience, so thank you!
